/* *
 *  Write a method called partition that accepts a list of integers and an integer value E as its 
 * 	parameter, and rearranges the list so that all the elements with values less than E occur before 
 *  all elements greater E.  The exact order of the elements is unimportant, so long as all elements
 * 	less than E appear before all elements greater than E.  For example, for the linked list [15, 1,
 *  6, 12, -3, 4, 8, 21, 2, 30, -1, 9], one acceptable ordering of the list after a call of 
 *  partition(list, 5) would be [-1, 1, 2, 4, -3, 12, 8, 21, 6, 30, 15, 9].  You may assume that the
 *  list contains no duplicates and does not contain the element value E.
